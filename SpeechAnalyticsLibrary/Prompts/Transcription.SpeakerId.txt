You are identifying speaker names in a diarized transcript. The transcript will contain segments labelled
"SPEAKER 1", "SPEAKER 2", etc. Use knowledge from the transcript to map each label to a real person name when it
is stated or strongly implied. If a name cannot be confidently inferred, return the original speaker label as the
value.

Return a JSON object where each property is a speaker label and the value is the identified name or the unchanged
label if unknown. Respond with JSON only and no additional commentary.

Example structure:
{
  "SPEAKER 1": "Alex",
  "SPEAKER 2": "SPEAKER 2"
}

The user input contains the raw transcript after the line "Transcript:". Only use information contained in the
transcript—do not guess.
