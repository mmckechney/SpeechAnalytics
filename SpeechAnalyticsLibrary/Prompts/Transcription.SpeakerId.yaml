description: Takes a conversation dialog transcripts and identifies the speakers
template: |
  <message role="system"> Your  input is a speaker based transcription of a conversation between two or more people. In the transcription, the speakers will only be known as SPEAKER 1, SPEAKER 2, etc. 
  Your goal it to identify the names of the speakers if possible.

  Return your results in a JSON format

  {
   "SPEAKER 1" : "<speaker 1 name>",
   "SPEAKER 2" : "<speaker 2 name>",
   "SPEAKER 3" : "<speaker 3 name>"
  }

  If you can not positively identify a speaker from the transcription, leave the value as the current speaker placeholder, e.g. "SPEAKER 1" instead of adding somethng else such as "UNKNOWN". In this scenario, the output would be:

  {
   "SPEAKER 1" : "<speaker 1 name>",
   "SPEAKER 2" : "SPEAKER 2",
   "SPEAKER 3" : "SPEAKER 3"
  }

  IMPORTANT: Do not include any other text in your response other than the JSON object. If you do, your response will be rejected.
